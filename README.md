Hello! Here's my first simple calculator website, this is formally mi first javascript project

It may not be something new, or me reinventing the wheel, but i'm proud of what i've done here!

[What-i-learned]

With this calculator i learned how to control and interact with the DOM, beside of that, everything is very simple, and it's explained with the comments i left in the 'functions.js' file

[Documentation]

Here's the tutorial that inspired me to make my version of it, the calculator of this video it's muuch more simple, only with one line of code, but a litte bit of more html work, i just "automatizedit-ish", lol
